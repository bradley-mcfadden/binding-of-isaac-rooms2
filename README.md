<h1>Binding of Isaac Room Generator</h1>
<p><t>This is a graph theory app in Processing that shows how rooms in the popular rogue-lite, 
The Binding of Isaac, might be generated.
  
<p><t>It generates many rooms on a grid the size of the window.  
Rooms are always regular in size.
  
<p><t>It uses Prim's algorithm to generate a spanning tree, 
  removes disconnected rooms, and makes the graph more densely 
  connected by randomly adding in edges.
